# Integration Guide for Assignment 14

This guide will help you consolidate your previous assignments into a single, cohesive repository for Assignment 14. The goal is to prepare your AI-Powered Smart Appointment Booking System for open-source collaboration.

## Step 1: Choose Your Main Repository

Use your AI-Powered Smart Appointment Booking System repository as the main repository:
```
https://github.com/ncayiyane/AI-Powered-Smart-Appointment-Booking-System-.git
```

## Step 2: Add Assignment 14 Files to Your Main Repository

Upload the following files from your Assignment 14 folder to your main repository:

1. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Guidelines for contributors
2. **ROADMAP.md** - Future development plans
3. **LICENSE** - MIT License for your project
4. **README.md** - Updated with "Getting Started" and "Features for Contribution" sections
5. **ISSUE_TEMPLATES.md** - Templates for creating issues (you can rename this to `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` for GitHub to recognize it)

## Step 3: Integrate Relevant Code from Previous Assignments

### From Assignment 5
This assignment likely contained initial project planning. Ensure your main repository includes:
- System requirements documentation
- Initial architecture planning

### From Assignment 7
Include any backend API implementations or database models.

### From Assignment 8
Incorporate any frontend components or user interface designs.

### From Assignment 9 & 10
Add testing frameworks and test cases to ensure code quality.

### From Assignment 11
Include any CI/CD configuration files in a `.github/workflows` directory.

### From Assignment 12
Incorporate any additional features or improvements.

## Step 4: Create Labeled Issues

Using your ISSUE_TEMPLATES.md as a guide:

1. Create at least 5 issues labeled as `good-first-issue`:
   - Patient Dashboard UI implementation
   - Appointment Reminder Notifications
   - Accessibility Features
   - Doctor Availability Calendar
   - Multilingual Support

2. Create at least 3 issues labeled as `feature-request`:
   - AI Scheduling Algorithm
   - EHR System Integration
   - Telemedicine Integration

## Step 5: Update Repository Structure

Ensure your repository has a clear structure:

```
Repository/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/          # CI/CD configuration from Assignment 11/13
├── src/                    # Source code from previous assignments
│   ├── api/                # Backend API components
│   ├── ai/                 # AI scheduling algorithms
│   ├── frontend/           # User interface components
│   └── tests/              # Test cases
├── docs/                   # Documentation
├── ARCHITECTURE.md         # From your main repository
├── CONTRIBUTING.md         # From Assignment 14
├── LICENSE                 # From Assignment 14
├── README.md               # Updated from Assignment 14
├── ROADMAP.md              # From Assignment 14
└── SPECIFICATION.md        # From your main repository
```

## Step 6: Share for Peer Review

1. Push all changes to your repository
2. Share the repository link with classmates
3. Track engagement in VOTING_RESULTS.md
4. Complete your reflection in REFLECTION.md

## Step 7: Final Submission

For your final submission, include:
1. Link to your consolidated repository
2. Completed REFLECTION.md
3. Updated VOTING_RESULTS.md with peer engagement metrics

## Notes on Repository Consolidation

When consolidating multiple repositories, focus on creating a coherent narrative:

1. Your README.md should clearly explain the project's purpose and how different components work together
2. The CONTRIBUTING.md should make it easy for new contributors to understand how to get started
3. The ROADMAP.md should show a clear vision for future development
4. Labeled issues should provide clear entry points for contributors of different skill levels

Remember that the goal of Assignment 14 is to prepare your repository for open-source collaboration, so focus on documentation quality, onboarding process, and engagement metrics.
