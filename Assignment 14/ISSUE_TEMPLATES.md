# Issue Templates and Labels

This document provides templates for creating issues with appropriate labels for your repository.

## Good First Issues

These issues are suitable for newcomers to the project. They should be relatively simple tasks that help contributors get familiar with the codebase.

### Template for Good First Issues:

```markdown
## Create Patient Dashboard UI

**Description:**
Implement a user-friendly patient dashboard for viewing upcoming appointments and medical history.

**Requirements:**
- Create responsive UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Implement appointment list view with filtering options
- Add medical history summary section
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
- Include notification center for appointment reminders

**Expected Outcome:**
A clean, intuitive dashboard that allows patients to view their appointments and basic medical information.

**Resources:**
- [Design mockups in Figma](link-to-figma)
- [WCAG 2.1 Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)

**Labels:** good-first-issue, enhancement, frontend
```

### More Good First Issue Ideas:

   - Add email and SMS notification system for upcoming appointments
   - Label: `good-first-issue`, `enhancement`

2. **Improve Accessibility Features**
   - Enhance system accessibility for users with disabilities
   - Label: `good-first-issue`, `accessibility`

3. **Create Doctor Availability Calendar**
   - Implement interactive calendar view for doctor scheduling
   - Label: `good-first-issue`, `frontend`

4. **Add Multilingual Support**
   - Implement i18n framework for supporting multiple languages
   - Label: `good-first-issue`, `enhancement`

5. **Implement Patient Feedback System**
   - Create post-appointment feedback collection mechanism
   - Label: `good-first-issue`, `feature`

## Feature Requests

These issues represent more substantial enhancements to the project. They typically require more planning and implementation effort.

### Template for Feature Requests:

```markdown
## Implement AI Appointment Scheduling Algorithm

**Description:**
Develop an intelligent scheduling algorithm that optimizes appointment times based on various factors.

**Requirements:**
- Create machine learning model for predicting appointment duration
- Implement algorithm to minimize wait times and maximize resource utilization
- Consider patient preferences and doctor availability
- Include handling for urgent appointments
- Develop API endpoints for integration with the frontend

**Expected Outcome:**
An AI-powered scheduling system that efficiently allocates appointments while balancing patient and provider needs.

**Technical Considerations:**
- Use Python with scikit-learn or TensorFlow for ML components
- Ensure algorithm performance scales with large datasets
- Include comprehensive unit and integration tests

**Labels:** feature-request, enhancement, ai, backend
```

### More Feature Request Ideas:

1. **EHR System Integration**
   - Develop integration with electronic health record systems
   - Label: `feature-request`, `integration`

2. **Predictive Analytics Dashboard**
   - Create analytics dashboard with predictive insights
   - Label: `feature-request`, `analytics`

3. **Telemedicine Integration**
   - Add video consultation capabilities to the appointment system
   - Label: `feature-request`, `feature`

## How to Use These Templates

1. Go to the Issues tab in your GitHub repository
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Use one of these templates as a starting point
4. Apply the appropriate labels to categorize the issue
5. Assign to a contributor or leave unassigned for someone to pick up

Remember to keep issues focused on a single task or feature to make them more approachable for contributors.
