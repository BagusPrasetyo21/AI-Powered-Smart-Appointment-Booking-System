## üîç Project Overview

The AI-Powered Smart Appointment Booking System addresses common challenges in medical appointment scheduling:

- **Inefficient Manual Scheduling**: Eliminates the need for patients to manually search for available time slots
- **Schedule Optimization**: Reduces gaps and overbookings in doctor schedules
- **Intelligent Allocation**: Adapts to patient preferences and appointment urgency
- **Administrative Efficiency**: Reduces staff workload for managing appointments

This project is structured as a series of educational assignments that collectively build a comprehensive medical appointment booking system with AI-driven scheduling capabilities.

## üìö API Documentation

The system exposes RESTful APIs through FastAPI:

### Patient Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/patients` | GET | Get all patients |
| `/api/patients/{id}` | GET | Get patient by ID |
| `/api/patients` | POST | Create new patient |
| `/api/patients/{id}` | PUT | Update patient |
| `/api/patients/{id}` | DELETE | Delete patient |

### Doctor Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/doctors` | GET | Get all doctors |
| `/api/doctors/{id}` | GET | Get doctor by ID |
| `/api/doctors` | POST | Create new doctor |
| `/api/doctors/{id}` | PUT | Update doctor |
| `/api/doctors/{id}` | DELETE | Delete doctor |

### Appointment Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/appointments` | GET | Get all appointments |
| `/api/appointments/{id}` | GET | Get appointment by ID |
| `/api/appointments` | POST | Create new appointment |
| `/api/appointments/{id}` | PUT | Update appointment |
| `/api/appointments/{id}` | DELETE | Cancel appointment |
| `/api/appointments/patient/{patient_id}` | GET | Get patient's appointments |
| `/api/appointments/doctor/{doctor_id}` | GET | Get doctor's appointments |

## üß† AI Scheduling Logic (Planned Implementation)

The system is designed to incorporate AI-driven scheduling with these components:

1. **Patient Preference Analysis**
   - Track historical booking patterns
   - Identify preferred days, times, and doctors

2. **Urgency Classification**
   - Categorize appointments based on type and urgency
   - Prioritize time-sensitive appointments

3. **Availability Optimization**
   - Maintain real-time availability data
   - Prevent scheduling conflicts

4. **Recommendation Engine**
   - Suggest optimal time slots based on multiple factors
   - Continuously improve through feedback

5. **Load Balancing**
   - Distribute appointments among doctors
   - Consider specialization and workload

## üîÆ Future Development

### Short-term Goals
- Complete AI scheduling algorithm implementation
- Add database persistence layer
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Develop frontend user interface

### Mid-term Goals
