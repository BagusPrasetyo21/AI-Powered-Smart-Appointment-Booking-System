## 🧩 Problem Statement
Traditional appointment booking systems often suffer from:

❌ **Inefficiency** – Users must manually search for available time slots, which can be time-consuming and frustrating.

❌ **Overbooking or Gaps** – Service providers frequently deal with overbooked schedules or idle gaps between appointments due to poor time management.

❌ **Lack of Intelligence** – Most systems do not adapt to user behavior, urgency, or preferences.

❌ **Administrative Overload** – Staff waste time managing bookings and rescheduling appointments manually.

## ✅ Our Solution
We introduce an AI-Powered Smart Appointment Booking System that:

✅ **Uses AI to Recommend Optimal Time Slots**

## 🧠 AI Scheduling Logic

The `ai_scheduler.py` module employs sophisticated algorithms to prioritize and allocate appointment slots effectively. The system uses a combination of rule-based systems and machine learning models to optimize scheduling:

### Key Components:

1. **User Preference Analysis**
   - Tracks and analyzes historical booking patterns
   - Identifies preferred days, times, and service providers

2. **Urgency Classification**
   - Categorizes appointments based on urgency levels
   - Prioritizes time-sensitive appointments

3. **Availability Optimization**
   - Maintains real-time availability data for all service providers
   - Prevents double-bookings and minimizes schedule gaps

4. **Recommendation Engine**
   - Suggests optimal time slots based on multiple factors
   - Continuously improves through feedback loops

5. **Load Balancing**
   - Distributes appointments evenly among service providers
   - Considers provider specialization and workload

### Algorithm Flow:

```
1. Collect user preferences and appointment details
2. Calculate urgency score based on appointment type and user inputs
3. Retrieve available time slots from all relevant service providers
4. Apply weighted scoring to each available slot based on:
   - Match with user preferences
   - Provider availability and specialization
   - Time slot efficiency (minimizing gaps)
   - Urgency requirements
5. Return top N recommended slots to the user
6. Update recommendation model based on user selection
```

This intelligent scheduling ensures efficient and user-centric appointment management while optimizing resource utilization.

## 🔒 Authentication & Security

The system implements robust security measures to protect user data and ensure secure access:

### Authentication Flow:
- **Registration**: Secure user registration with email verification
